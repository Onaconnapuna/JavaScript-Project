Chess is a game with uncountable positions and contingencies, but among these positions are opening positions, which are much more quantifiable and can lead to more favorable positons in the middle game if studied. The purpose of this project is to display the most popular and efficient chess openings accompanied win-percentage statisics. 

In the Chess Openings page, users will be able to:
1. Scroll through openings with win-percentage statistics
2. View a display toggling for each opening
2. Be able to move pieces on the board 
4. See how the win-perctage changes after a moved piece 

In addition, this project will include 
1. A link to lichess.com to play chess
2. Instructions on how to use the page

See chess page wireframe for the wireframe

Technologies include :
Lichess open source Api
Canvas Api Library
D3 for statistics
Babel and Webpack

Implementation Timeline: 

I hope to have a rendered board by Sunday, and hopefully by then I have figured out integrating the Api. By Tuesday I hope to have most of the functionality done, and by next Thursday a finished project, dedicating the last few days to styling and polishing
