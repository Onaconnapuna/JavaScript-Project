Chess is a game with uncountable positions and contingencies, but among these positions are opening positions, which are much more quantifiable and can lead to more favorable positons in the middle game if studied. The purpose of this project is to display the most popular and efficient chess openings accompanied win-percentage statisics. 

In the Chess Openings page, users will be able to:
1. Allow the user to select a move from the suggested moves
2. See how that move affects the favorability of the position

In addition, this project will include 
1. A link to lichess.com to play chess
2. Instructions on how to use the page

* Technologies include :
    * Lichess open source Api to reference chess moves and position analysis
    * Javascript to dynamically alter the page
    * HTML and CSS for structure and styling
    * Babel and Webpack for testing and development 

Implementation Timeline: 

I hope to have a rendered board by Sunday, and hopefully by then I have figured out integrating the Api. By Tuesday I hope to have most of the functionality done, and by next Thursday a finished project, dedicating the last few days to styling and polishing
