    <h1>Chess Openings Reference</h1> 

    <!-- <div id="Instructions">
        <p>
            This Application references the games played by chess Grandmasters from the Lichess Api which has millions of positions to references, 
            you will see that there are a few selected moves to your right representing the most common moves played. You may select a move and then
            reference the meters to the right of the board which indicate the percentage of games that were won when that move was played. Since this 
            a chess openings reference, you will only be able to select the first ten moves. This is also partly due to the fact that data gets much more 
            scarce as positions get more and more unique.
